<h3>About</h3>

<p>This project is about getting some basic knowledge about Wordpress and how to create your own theme.
I have created this basic theme from scratch and although there is room for improvment I feel that when I created this I got a better understanding on how to work with Wordpress.</p>

<p>For someone how has never used wordpress or really used php it was a challenge, but with the help of some tutorials I managed to create this theme that I call "My portfolio"</p>
